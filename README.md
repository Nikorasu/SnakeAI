## Training a Neural Network to play Snake

This project is still being worked on. So far I have the base game setup for a NN, with rewards, built from a modified version of MiniSnakes.
I'm still trying to find the right parameters to actually get the NN to learn to play snake. For now, most everything else works.

I also made the dumbot and smrtbot versions, which play themselves using old-fashion bot methods.
These might be useful for generating decent data to train the NN off later.
